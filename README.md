# Card Deck Program

## Description
This is a Java-based card deck program that allows users to perform various operations on a standard deck of 52 playing cards. The program provides a menu-driven interface for interacting with the deck, including shuffling, printing, finding, and comparing cards.

## Features

- **Print a Random Card** – Prints a single random card.
- **Find a Card** – Searches for a specific card based on rank and suit.
- **Shuffle Deck** – Randomly shuffles the deck.
- **Deal 5 Random Cards** – Deals five random cards from the deck.
- **Compare Two Cards** – Checks if two cards have the same rank.
- **Check Suit Match** – Determines if two cards belong to the same suit.

## Files Included
- `Main.java` – Contains the main program logic and menu system.
- `Deck.java` – Implements the deck operations using an `ArrayList` of `Card` objects.
- `Card.java` – Represents a single playing card with rank and suit attributes.

## How to Run
1. **Compile the files**  
   ```sh
   javac Main.java Deck.java Card.java
2. **Run the program**
   ```sh
      java Main
3. **Follow the on-screen menu to interact with the deck**
